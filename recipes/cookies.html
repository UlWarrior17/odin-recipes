    <p>These festive Christmas cookie bars are like a holiday chocolate chip cookie in bar form. They come together
    quickly—using just one bowl—and they don't require an electric mixer. Just mix up the dough, bake, and you'll be
    enjoying a delicious Christmas-y treat in no time!</p>

        <li>3/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 extra large egg, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips, plus extra for sprinkling on top</li>
        <li>1/2 cup holiday M&Ms, plus extra for sprinkling on top</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons holiday jimmy sprinkles, plus extra for sprinkling on top</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch square pan with enough parchment paper to have
            overhang on all sides.</li>
        <li>
            Whisk melted butter, brown sugar, white sugar, salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Add
            in egg and vanilla and mix until thoroughly incorporated. Add in flour and baking soda and mix until just combined. Fold
            in chocolate chips, M&Ms, and sprinkles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour batter into the prepared pan and spread into an even layer. Sprinkle a few more chocolate chips, M&Ms, and
            sprinkles evenly over the top of the batter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until bars are puffed and begin to turn golden brown on top, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from
            the oven; cool completely before cutting into bars.
        </li>
    </ol>
