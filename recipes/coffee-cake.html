    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) with an oven rack set in the center of the oven. Grease a 9 x 9 inch
        pan with nonstick spray, and line the pan with parchment paper, allowing at least 2 inch of excess on each side (these
        will act as handles to make for an easier removal later).</li>
    <li>
        Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>
        Make the crumble: Stir flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt together in a bowl until combined. Add butter and
        use your hands or a pastry cutter to mix until butter is fully incorporated, and mixture forms moistened clumps. It
        should no longer appear powdery. Set aside.</li>
    <li>
        Make the cake: in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream butter, sugar, and brown sugar
        on medium speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
    <li>
        Add eggs, 1 at a time, mixing well on medium speed to incorporate and scraping the bowl well after each addition.</li>
    <li>
        In a bowl, whisk flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together to combine. Add about half of
        the mixture to the mixer and mix on low speed to combine, then scrape the bowl well.</li>
    <li>In a bowl, whisk flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together to combine. Add about half of
    the mixture to the mixer and mix on low speed to combine, then scrape the bowl well.</li>
    <li>With the mixer running on low speed, add buttermilk in a slow, steady stream and mix until incorporated. Add remaining
    half of the dry ingredients and mix to combine.</li>
    <li>Pour half of the batter into the prepared cake pan, and spread into an even layer. Sprinkle about half of the crumble
    mixture over the batter in an even layer.</li>
    <li>Pour remaining batter on top, and spread into an even layer. Top batter with remaining crumble, scattering it fairly
    evenly across the surface.</li>
    <li>Transfer cake to the preheated oven and bake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few moist
    crumbs, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
    <li>Cool the cake completely in the pan, then use the excess parchment paper to gently unmold the cake and transfer to a
    cutting board. Slice the cake into 9 pieces, then peel it away from the parchment paper to serve.</li>
