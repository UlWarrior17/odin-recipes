    <p><strong>Servings:</strong> 9</p>
    <p><strong>Yield:</strong> 9 croissants</p>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons instant nonfat dry milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons instant yeast</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
        <li>9 ounces semisweet chocolate chunks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>
        Gather the ingredients.</li>
    <li>
        Pour water into a bread machine pan; add flour. Sprinkle milk powder over flour. Place sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons of
        softened butter into the corners of the pan. Make a small indent in the top of the dry ingredients and place yeast in
        the indent. Run the bread machine on the basic dough setting.</li>
    <li>
        Meanwhile, lay out a sheet of waxed or parchment paper. Shape the remaining 1/2 cup of butter into a 3x5-inch rectangle
        on the waxed paper; wrap and chill until ready to use.</li>
    <li>
        Remove butter from the refrigerator and allow to soften while you roll out dough. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured
        surface; roll into a 8x12-inch rectangle. Place butter on half of the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border of dough on 3
        sides. Fold the other half of dough over butter and press the edges firmly to seal.</p>
    <li>
        Roll the dough out to a 6x14-inch rectangle. Fold the dough in thirds from the long ends, as you would fold a business
        letter. Cover dough loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 20 minutes.</p>
    <li>
        Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Place it onto a lightly floured surface so that the folded edge faces you. Roll
        the dough out again into a 6x14-inch rectangle, and fold into thirds. Cover with plastic and chill for 20 minutes.</p>
    <li>Repeat step 5, then chill the dough for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, beat together the egg yolk and milk; set aside. Grease two baking sheets.</p>
    <li>Roll dough out into a 12x21-inch rectangle. Cut dough into thirds in both directions, to make 9 rectangles. Divide
    chocolate among the rectangles. Lightly brush egg yolk mixture around the edges of each piece. Starting at a short end,
    roll each piece of dough around the chocolate; press the edges together to seal.</li>
    <li>TPlace the croissants onto the prepared baking sheets; cover with greased plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place
    until they have doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Brush the top of the pastries with the remaining egg yolk mixture.</p>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer
    croissants to wire racks. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>To reduce the 'day of' preparation time, make the dough and refrigerate the unbaked rolls overnight. Pull them out 1
    hour before baking in the morning to come to room temperature.</p>
